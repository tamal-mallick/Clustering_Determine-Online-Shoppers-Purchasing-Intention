Determining-Online-Shoppers-Purchasing-Intention-using-Clustering

This is a classification problem, but instead I used the dataset to find groupings through K-means clustering. I grouped online shoppers into distinct groups corresponding to those who intend to buy ("TRUE" in the Target column) vs those who don't intend to buy ("FALSE" in the Target column). I only used the target column to check overall accuracy of predicted clusters.
